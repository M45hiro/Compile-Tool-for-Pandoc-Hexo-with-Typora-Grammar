# Compile-Tool-for-Pandoc-Hexo-with-Typora-Grammar

A Markdown compiler designed to process inline and block LaTeX equations for Pandoc and Hexo, with Typora-compatible grammar adjustments. This tool ensures that math formulas are properly escaped and formatted for rendering in Hexo blogs using MathJax or KaTeX.

## Features

- **Typora rendering consistency**  
  Supports Typora syntax and ensures that what you see in Typora matches exactly what Hexo + Pandoc will render.

- **Automatic Markdown file discovery**  
  Recursively searches a specified folder for `.md` files.

- **Inline equation processing**  
  Detects all inline LaTeX formulas (wrapped in single `$`) and compiles them with proper escaping for Pandoc and Hexo.

- **Block equation processing**  
  Detects `\begin{equation}...\end{equation}` and `\begin{aligned}...\end{aligned}` blocks.  
  Adjusts `\quad` spacing commands and preserves correct backslashes for MathJax/KaTeX.

- **Typora grammar corrections**  
  Automatically removes unwanted spaces around `$` symbols, while keeping literal `$` signs intact.

- **Batch compilation**  
  Processes all Markdown files in a folder and outputs the compiled files to a dedicated `output/` folder.
